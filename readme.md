**Swift/Objective-C Example**

A sample application implemented in both Swift and Objective-C to show the differences in the project structure and code.

The app will place a pin on a map for a user specified location.

I make no claims this is ideal code in either Swift or Objective-C. Simply a quick hack to look at the differences and learn some Swift.
